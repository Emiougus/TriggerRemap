# Trigger Remap
Plugin for the PS Vita which allows you to remap R2/L2 to any location on the rear touchpad

## How to Use
Put `TriggerRemap.suprx` in `ur0:tai/` and add `ur0:tai/TriggerRemap.suprx` under `*ALL` in your config.txt
#### Configurator App 
Install TriggerRemap.vpk through vitashell

Open the TriggerRemap configurator and create the config file with the create button in the bottom left corner
#### Manual Config
Create `TriggerRemap.txt` in `ux0:data/`

Configuration formatting is `L2=X:500,Y:350;R2=X:1300,Y:350`

## Known Issues
In Ratchet and Clank 2 jumping to the side while strafing, ratchet doesn't always perform a sideways flip
PSTV Support hasn't been tested, may or may not work

Sometimes the App will show an error about fonts not being able to be loaded, just spam X until it loads, unsure why this happens
